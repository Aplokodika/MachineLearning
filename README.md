## Third party contributors are welcomed!!! 

We encourage and accept any kind of external contribution because our project is in currently in its early stages of development. We are looking forward to learning and sharing ideas with developers like you, so that we may together grow our skills and knowledge in this area. If you are really interested in machine learning, and if you want to team up with someone to learn and gain experience collaboratively, you are in the right place!

#Project files


1.	[Test Files](https://github.com/Aplokodika/MachineLearning/tree/master/ToBeTested/src/mainFnc)
2.	[The Neural Network library](https://github.com/Aplokodika/MachineLearning/tree/master/ToBeTested/src/neuralNetwork)

The test methods present in the file [Test Files](https://github.com/Aplokodika/MachineLearning/tree/master/ToBeTested/src/mainFnc) contain the source for quickly testing the system. The class file name must be renamed to MainFnc.java before testing. There are two packages in this project, as of now. `neuralNetwork` and `mainFnc`. The entire library of standard neural networks functionality will be built-into the same package. Other extensions and beyond the first milestone must be created in newer packages. 

# MachineLearning

The main motive is to create a good tool for conducting AI experiments in vast areas. This must prove useful in diverse areas like biomedical analysis, stock market analysis and weather data analysis. The algorithms implemented here are deep learning (Neural Networks) and Genetic Algorithms. This project must also in turn provide a vast benchmarking situations where this software proves efficient. There must be a way of hybrid implementation of both neural networks and the genetic algorithm. 

Enhanced efficiency of a software in adapting to newer scenarios greatly depends on the simplicity of the code.  And creating code with the utmost simplicity is the fundamental aim of this organization. 

#Aplokodika's ultimate motive

"Making things simple is an art itself. Especially making things simple for coding."

Numerous programs specialized for various purposes are written each day to meet up with the changes taking place in the technological world. Every new technology that is created go off-trend before we can fully comprehend the change it has brought about. This forces numerous software companies and organizations to adapt to such changes at a faster rate. The simpler the code is, the faster it can be used to adapt. The ultimate goal of Aplokodika is developing tools for developers which in turn helps them implement their design as quickly as possible. 


#Basic methodologies for attaining this goal (July 5, 2016.): 

Note: these methods are dynamic and are subject to changes often. 

1. When referred to the “development process” this article refers to the exact set of steps taken by the developer in creating a component. 
2. When referred to “logging development process”, this article refers to the code that was added, deleted and retained by the developer. It is a strict log on what the developers had in their mind while writing a particular code. This generally goes beyond the level of documentation. It must also include the time-line of the developer's learning process as he codes. 

The development process should proceed with, following defined guidelines of coding conventions as described by well accepted standards. Each developer must log his development process as accurate as possible. This is so important that to maintain a good log, the developer may also compromise coding time. This is important as it lets newer users who use the libraries/code developed in this organization get hold of using it as quick as possible with medium or low knowledge on the area.

This process ensures that the new user follows the footsteps of the original developers to further understand the functionality of the code. Data abstraction is necessary, but at the same time, there should be a proper access to information on the middle and the low-level code present in the software. While extending the software functionality or while adapting a part of the code in other applications, the functionality of the code is required to be clear. This can only be done when the developer logs the development process as this would then give a chance for the newer users to understand the more prominent mistakes a developer may make while developing a particular software. 

Being familiar with the mistakes one can make while developing a program at times is more important than the right way to do it.
