# MachineLearning

The main motive is to create a good tool for conducting AI experiments in vast areas. This must prove useful in diverse areas like biomedical analysis, stock market analysis and whether data analysis. The algorithms implemented here are deep learning (Neural Networks) and Genetic Algorithms. This project must also in turn provide a vast benchmarking situations where this software proves efficient. There must be a way of hybrid implementation of both neural networks and the genetic algorithm. 

Enhanced efficiency of a software in adapting to newer scenarios greatly depends on the simplicity of the code.  And creating code with the utmost simplicity is the fundamental aim of this organization.
